7. When to Choose Each
● Choose MUI Data Grid Premium If:
○ You are already using Material-UI in your project.
○ Your dataset size is relatively small to medium (10k-50k rows).
○ Your app doesn't require real-time updates or high-frequency data changes.
○ Cost is a major factor.
● Choose AG Grid Enterprise If:
○ You need to handle large datasets (100k+ rows).
○ Your platform requires real-time data updates (e.g., stock prices, live trading).
○ You need advanced features like pivoting, grouping, or in-grid charts.
○ You need extensive customizability and enterprise-grade support.
○
POC Suggestions
To create a fair Proof of Concept (POC):
1. Dataset:
○ Use a dataset with 100,000+ rows and multiple columns to test performance.
○ Simulate real-time updates (e.g., WebSocket or intervals).
2. Performance Metrics:
○ Measure initial load time.
○ Measure rendering speed for scrolling (virtualization).
○ Test responsiveness to real-time updates (e.g., 10 updates/sec).
3. Features:
○ Test critical features for your trading platform (e.g., inline editing, grouping,
sorting, etc.).
○ Evaluate export functionality (e.g., CSV/Excel).
4. Customizability:
○ Implement custom cell rendering for specific trading data (e.g., price changes
with color coding).
5. Integration:
○ Evaluate how well the grid integrates with your existing React app and thirdparty libraries.
Conclusion
For a trading platform, AG Grid Enterprise is likely the better choice due to its superior
performance, scalability, and advanced features tailored for real-time data handling.
However, if your requirements are less demanding and you're already using Material-UI,
MUI Data Grid Premium can be a cost-effective and simpler solution.
